## 5C Grim Trident Bypass
If you like this consider insiding for us.

## Usage
- Download [MeteorClient](https://meteorclient.com) for 1.20.4
- Download [GrimTrident](https://github.com/5cmc/grim-trident/releases/latest)
- Place a trident enchanted with riptide in your hotbar

**Use the following settings to creative fly on 2b2t:**
  - Enable the `Grim Disabler` module
  - Enable the `Flight` module and tune the `speed` until you stop getting rubber-banded (0.25 is a good starting point)

**Other useful modules that can be used with** `Grim Disabler` **are:**
  - Anti Hunger
  - Air Jump
  - Boat Fly
  - Click Tp
  - Elytra Fly
  - Jesus
  - Step (and Reverse Step)
  - Velocity
  - No Slow

If it breaks try landing, turning off all movement hacks, and eating something.

## Module Options
`Grim`
 - Required for servers using Grim Anticheat (like 2b2t)

`Overdrive`
  - Good for travelling but buggy when breaking/placing blocks

`Pause on eat`
  - Stops sending trident packets when interacting with items
  - Allows you to eat while using Grim Disabler

`Pause on inventory`
  - Stops sending trident packets when picking up items with your cursor
  - Allows you to pick up and move items around your inventory while using Grim Disabler
